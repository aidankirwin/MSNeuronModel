# State-Space Biological Neuron Model Dynamics in Multiple Sclerosis

## Project Summary

The primary effect of the inflammatory response associated with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is damage to the myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) [1]. Myelin enables saltatory conduction along the axon. As a result, demyelination affects both conduction velocity and, consequently, neural activity in the CNS [1]. To investigate the effects of demyelination, three simulations were conducted on a state-space biological neuron model. The model consists of a Hodgkin-Huxley circuit analog model representing unmyelinated axon segments, and a single cable model representing myelinated segments (internodes). The simulations examined three different effects: the gradual deterioration of myelin at every myelinated region along an axon, the complete loss of myelin for an increasing number of internodes, and the substitution of myelinated regions with Nodes of Ranvier. The first simulation indicated a negative correlation between conduction velocity, firing rate, and myelin degradation. The second simulation showed a similar relationship between an increasing number of completely demyelinated regions and conduction velocity and firing rate. The third simulation found a greater firing rate and conductance velocity for axons with many internodes versus those with fewer internodes.
